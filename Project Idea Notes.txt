Geological Prediction
Here's a link that might be worth having a look at: http://geospatial-solutions.com/tag/crowdsourcing/
Also... I saw that the folks at IBM and GoldCorp put something out on their project at Red Lake.  I thought you might be interested.. it is a good explanation of what I want to do/why I decided to take this course.  It kind of gives you an idea of the kinds of things that I am hoping to learn/and maybe incorporate if possible into the case study... even if in a small way... https://www-01.ibm.com/common/ssi/cgi-bin/ssialias?htmlfid=73015073USEN

US Aid impact on local economies 
Based on the data available, what kind of affect is US foreign aid having on local economies? Is it positive or negative? 
Dr. Scotts Project
It is an ongoing project in his research lab, so I'm not sure how that would be different than other project ideas, but I wanted to make sure you got that information as well. I'm pasting that below this message

In our digital society, with its ubiquitous network-connected mobile devices, we have become increasingly reliant on having geospatial information at our fingertips. We use this information for personal navigation, location-based services (e.g., weather alerts, traffic information, etc.), and location-aware search results. As a consequence, service providers have created numerous methods to accept feedback, refinement, and even new data from the crowd of users (crowd-sourcing). Of particular interest are voluntary geospatial information (VGI) sites that provide both web and API access to data. In this project, we have ingested large geographic regions of VGI into a system that supports multi-modal analytics. Specifically, we intake a variety of auxiliary semantic and contextual information about geospatial places of interest, such as free text annotations, user-supplied images (ground photos), place information (anthropogenic use) and other metadata. Our crowd-sourced information miner (CIM) system enables linked analysis of the VGI combining techniques such as geospatial queries (time, space), metadata filtering, natural language processing (topic, entity, and sentiment analysis), information retrieval (search engine style access), and visual analytics (deep machine learning image matching of ground photos). --- Here is a suggestion for a case study project for a group of 3-4
The case study will be to do the following: 1) Review and understand the database design, including some of the DBMS extensions 2) Run data ingestion over the State of Missouri and potentially another state of interest. 3) Formulate a set of Candidate Questions that can be answered from the data 4) Explore the collected data in one or two modalities (metadata, text analytics, geospatially, etc.) to determine which candidate questions can be answered 5) Develop data storyboards to answer one or two key questions from the data.
